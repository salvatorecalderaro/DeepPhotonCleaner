# DeepPhotonCleaner
**DeepPhotonCleaner** is a deep learning tool designed to remove *solar flare* contaminations from cosmic background emission signals. Unlike traditional methods that discard entire segments of data, DeepPhotonCleaner accurately identifies and removes only those photons likely associated with solar flares.
